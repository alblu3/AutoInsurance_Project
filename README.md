# AutoInsurance_Project
This repository contains car insurance data science & machine learning project. The dataset in this project is taken from Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/ranja7/vehicle-insurance-customer-data) with the file name of "AutoInsurance.csv". This dataset is uploaded around year 2019 with Kaggle account name Ranja Sarkar. Dataset is filled with car insurance customers data with every characteristic of the customer. This dataset has numeric and categorical variables. This project consists of notebook files as well as the dataset in csv format.

========================================================================== 1.Business_Problem_and_Data_Understanding.ipynb

This notebook contains the background of the project and business problem that we can identify from the dataset. Explanation of each column in the dataset is defined as well based on the insurance domain knowledge.

========================================================================== 2.DataCleaning_and_DataPreprocessing.ipynb

This notebook contains steps that we do to "clean" the data in order to be analyzed further. Data preprocessing process is to prepare the data to be used in a machine learning model in the next step.

========================================================================== 3.Analytical_Approach_and_Model.ipynb

This notebook consists of 3 sections. First section is EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to analyze the data further using the "clean" data. The result of EDA will explain some business insights that can be identified from data analysis and visualization exploration. Second section is machine learning model to predict new customer's monthly premium auto by using features that we can collect from the new customer. Third section is machine learning model to predict new customer's insurance total claim so we can identify new customer that is potentially have a high insurance claim in the future.

========================================================================== 4.Conclusion_and_Recommendation.ipynb

This notebook contains the conclusion from previous notebook and business impact that can profit to the compant and recommendation regarding this project as well as machine learning model that we made.

========================================================================== AutoInsurance.csv

Original dataset found in kaggle for this project.
